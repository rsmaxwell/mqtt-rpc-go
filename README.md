"# mqtt-rpc-go" 

# Overview

Some webapps rneed to use both a request/resonse and a publish/subscribe messaging model, to both make requests to a server which require a particular response (e.g. logon) and also to subscribe to events as thy happen (e.g. display share price). http works well for request/resonse but has to resort to polling to keep uptodate in a dynamic environment. MQTT was built around the publish/subscribe model and no in v5 supports request/resonse as well. This package uses these mqtt v5 features to provide an implementation of request/resonse messaging. 

*MQTT* requires a broker process to be running to which clients connect. In the case of mqtt-rpc there is one client (*Responder*) which listens to a well known topic, and sends replies to a reply_topic, the name of which was contained in the original request. There may be many *Requester* clients which send requests, and wait for a reply.  *Requester* clients can only make requests which are supported by the *Responder*.

The *MQTT* broker used in this app is **Mosquitto** for the broker. Connections to the *MQTT* broker, which will be exposed to the internet, need to be appropiatly secured
